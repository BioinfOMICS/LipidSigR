"Machine learning" provides many feature selection methods and classifiers for 
building binary classification models. Additionally, several following analyses 
help users evaluate algorithm performance and identify key lipid-related variables.

All of the input data of functions must be a SummarizedExperiment object constructed 
by `LipidSigR::as_summarized_experiment`. For detailed instructions for constructing 
SummarizedExperiment object, please read `vignette("1_tool_function")`.

* NOTE: Some functions will require `processed_se`, which is the SummarizedExperiment 
object after being processed by `LipidSigR::data_process`. Please read `vignette("1_tool_function")`.

```{r load LipidSigR, message = FALSE}
library(LipidSigR)
```

```{r load_data_DE, message = FALSE, include=FALSE, echo=FALSE}
data("ml_data")
se <- ml_data
# data processing
processed_se <- data_process(
    se, exclude_missing=TRUE, exclude_missing_pct=70, 
    replace_na_method='min', replace_na_method_ref=0.5, 
    normalization='Percentage')
```

# Model construction
In the machine learning section, we will apply various feature selection methods
and assess each feature's importance. Data on lipid species and lipid characteristics 
will be combined to predict a binary outcome using multiple machine-learning 
approaches, allowing us to identify the optimal feature combination for further analysis. 
Monte Carlo cross-validation (MCCV) will be used to evaluate model performance 
and achieve statistical significance.

Monte Carlo cross-validation (MCCV) is a model validation technique that creates 
multiple random datasets split into training and validation sets. This method 
helps prevent the development of unnecessarily large models and reduces the risk 
of over-fitting during calibration. By conducting split-sample cross-validation 
multiple times and aggregating the results, MCCV allows us to quantify the predictive 
performance of a candidate model robustly.

Each cross-validation run randomly divides the data into training and testing sets. 
The training data is used to select the top 2, 3, 5, 10, 20, 50, or 100 important 
features for model training. The model is then validated using the testing data. 
If the dataset contains fewer than 100 features, the maximum number of features 
is set to the total available. The proportion of data used for testing and the 
number of cross-validation iterations can be defined by the parameters `split_prop` 
and `nfold`, respectively. 
*(Note: Increasing the number of cross-validation iterations will result in longer computation times.)*

Feature selection methods are designed to identify and rank the most important 
variables for predicting the target outcome. Our platform offers two categories 
of feature selection methods: univariate and multivariate analysis.
In univariate analysis, methods such as p-value, p-value\*Fold Change, and ROC 
are used to compare each feature between two groups. The user can set the criteria 
for ranking the features. Based on users' settings, the top N features are chosen 
using metrics like -log10(p-value), -log10(p-value)\*Fold Change, or the Area 
Under Curve (AUC).
For multivariate analysis, we provide options including Random Forest, Linear 
SVM (`e1071`), Lasso (`glmnet`), Ridge (`glmnet`), and ElasticNet (`glmnet`). 
Random Forest (`ranger`) utilizes built-in feature importance metrics, while the other 
methods rank features based on the absolute values of their coefficients. 
*(Note: The names in parentheses indicate the software packages used.)*

The provided 8 feature ranking methods and 6 classification methods for training 
and selecting the best model are listed below.

    1. Feature ranking methods: p-value, p-value*FC, ROC, Random Forest, Linear SVM, Lasso, Ridge, ElasticNet.
    2. Classification methods: Random Forest, Linear SVM, Lasso, Ridge, ElasticNet, XGBoost.

```{r ML_model}
# lipid characteristic
char_list <- list_lipid_char(processed_se)

# construct machine learning model
ml_se <- ml_model(
    processed_se, char=c("class","Total.DB"), transform='log10',
    ranking_method='Random_forest', ml_method='Random_forest', 
    split_prop=0.3, nfold=10, alpha=NULL)
```

After running the above code, a SummarizedExperiment object `ml_se` will be
returned. It includes the input abundance data, lipid characteristic table, 
group information table, model results, and input parameter settings. 
You can view the data in `ml_se` by `LipidSigR::extract_summarized_experiment`.
Please read `vignette("1_tool_function")`.

```{r ml analysis: results}
# view machine learning analysis
ml_model_result <- extract_summarized_experiment(ml_se)

# result summary
summary(ml_model_result)
```

`ml_se` can also be used as input for plotting and further analyses such as 
[ROC/PR curve](#rocpr), [model performance](#eval), [predicted probability](#prob), 
[feature importance](#feaimp), and [network analysis](#network).

# ROC/PR curve {#rocpr}
Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) and Precision-Recall (PR) curves are commonly
used to assess the diagnostic performance of binary classifiers. The mean AUC and 
95% confidence interval for each feature count for both ROC and PR curves are calculated 
across all cross-validation (CV) runs. Generally, a higher AUC indicates better model 
performance. The PR curve is especially useful for datasets with a highly imbalanced 
class distribution (i.e., rare positive samples), providing a more informative measure 
of an algorithmâ€™s effectiveness in these cases [@davis2006relationship]. A random 
classifier typically yields an ROC-AUC around 0.5 and a PR-AUC close to the positive 
sample proportion. Conversely, an AUC of 1 for both metrics indicates perfect model performance.

To combine the testing results from all CV runs, 300 thresholds are evenly distributed 
from 0 to 1. The thresholds are then calculated for the corresponding sensitivity, 
specificity, precision, and recall with predicted probabilities and accurate labels of 
testing samples in each CV. These values are then averaged to plot a final ROC and PR curve.

Now, we are going to conduct calculation for plotting ROC curves first, and then the PR curves.

```{r ml_analysis: ROC curves}
# plotting ROC curves
roc_result <- plot_ml_roc(ml_se, feature_num=10)

# result summary
summary(roc_result)
```

For interpreting the results, the ROC curve is generated by plotting 'sensitivity' 
(the proportion of correctly classified positive samples) on the y-axis against 
'1-specificity' (the proportion of correctly classified negative samples) on the
x-axis, using various threshold values. Generally, a more robust model will have 
an ROC curve approaching the upper left corner.

```{r}
# view result: ROC curve plot
roc_result$static_mean_auc
```

**ROC curve plot**
The plot shows the average ROC curve for different feature numbers with their mean 
AUC and 95\% confidence interval.

```{r}
# view result: average ROC curve plot of 10 features
roc_result$static_roc
```

**Average ROC curve plot of 10 features**
The plot displays average ROC curves of user-defined features. Each CV is in grey, 
and the red line is the average of those cross-validations (CVs) for the ROC curves.


```{r ml_analysis: PR curve}
# plotting PR curves
pr_result <- plot_ml_pr(ml_se, feature_num=10)

# result summary
summary(pr_result)
```

The PR curve plots 'precision' (the proportion of actual positives out of predicted 
positive samples) on the y-axis and 'recall' (equal to sensitivity) on the x-axis. 
Generally, a more robust model will have a PR curve closer to the upper right corner.

```{r}
# view result: PR curve plot
pr_result$static_mean_auc
```

**PR curve plot**
The plot shows the average PR curve for different feature numbers with their mean 
AUC and 95\% confidence interval.

```{r}
# view result: average PR curve plot of 10 features
pr_result$static_pr
```

**Average PR curve plot of 10 features**
The plot displays the average PR curves of user-defined features. Each CV is in 
grey, and the red line is the average of those cross-validations (CVs) for the PR curves.


# Model performance {#eval}
After constructing the model, it is essential to evaluate its performance. We offer 
several valuable indicators for this purpose. For each feature count, we calculate 
and plot the average value and 95\% confidence interval of metrics such as accuracy, 
sensitivity (recall), specificity, positive predictive value (precision), negative 
predictive value, F1 score, prevalence, detection rate, detection prevalence, and 
balanced accuracy across all CV runs using the confusion matrix function in the 
caret package. Each of these indicators is defined in terms of true positives (TP), 
false positives (FP), false negatives (FN), and true negatives (TN).

Here, all the provided evaluation indicators are listed below. We can define the 
evaluation method by the parameter `eval_method`.

* Sensitivity = Recall $= \frac{TP}{(TP + FN)}$

* Specificity $= \frac{TN}{(FP + TN)}$

* Prevalence $= \frac{(TP + FN)}{(TP + FP + FN + TN)}$

* Positive predictive value (PPV) = Precision $= \frac{TP}{(TP + FP)}$

* Negative predictive value (NPV) $= \frac{TN}{(FN + TN)}$

* Detection rate $= \frac{TP}{(TP + FP + FN + TN)}$

* Detection prevalence $= \frac{(TP + FP)}{(TP + FP + FN + TN)}$

* F1 score $= \frac{2 \times Precision \times Recall}{(Precision + Recall)}$ 

```{r ML: model performance}
# conduct model evaluation
eval_result <- plot_ml_evaluation(ml_se, eval_method='Accuracy')

# result summary
summary(eval_result)

# view result: model performance plot
eval_result$static_evaluation_plot
```

**Model performance (Accuracy)**
The evaluation plot shows the model performance of accuracy. The highest value is marked in red.


# Predicted probability {#prob}
The average predicted probabilities for each sample in the testing data across all 
CV runs help us identify and investigate incorrect or uncertain labels.

```{r ML: predicted probability}
# compute and visualize the average predicted probabilities
prob_result <- plot_ml_probability(ml_se, feature_num=10)

# result summary
summary(prob_result)

# view result: the distribution of predicted probabilities
prob_result$static_probability_plot
```

**Probability plot**
In the plot showing the distribution of average sample probabilities across all 
CV runs, each point represents a sample, with its value being the mean prediction 
from all models in all cross-validations. The y-axis displays the predicted 
probabilities, indicating the likelihood that each machine learning model predicts 
a value of one. Specifically, the blue group represents samples where both the 
actual and predicted values are one, while the black group represents samples 
where the actual value is zero but the predicted value is one. Ideally, the black 
group should be as close to zero as possible, while the blue group should be as close to one.

```{r}
# view result: confusion matrix of sample number and proportion
prob_result$static_confusion_matrix
```

**Confusion matrix**
In the confusion matrix, the y-axis indicates the predicted class, and the x-axis 
is the actual class. Therefore, the upper left is a true positive, the upper right 
is a false positive, the lower left is a false negative, and the lower right is a 
true negative. The numbers are the counts, and the number in the bracket is the percentage.

# Feature importance {#feaimp}
After building a high-accuracy model, we examine each feature's contribution. 
Two methods, **'Algorithm-based'** and **'SHAP analysis'**, are provided to rank 
and visualize feature importance.

## Algorithm-based
In the **'Algorithm-based'** section, setting a specific feature count using the 
`feature_num` parameter displays the selection frequency and average importance of 
the top 10 features across all CV runs. For models like Linear SVM, Lasso, Ridge, 
and ElasticNet, feature importance will be based on their coefficients' absolute 
values, and Random Forest and XGBoost use their built-in feature importance metrics.

```{r ML: feature importance_algorithm-based}
# compute and rank the contribution of each feature
feature_result <- plot_ml_feature(ml_se, feature_num=10)

# result summary
summary(feature_result)

# view result: selected frequency plot
feature_result$static_selected_frequency
```

## SHAP analysis
The Shapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) method was recently introduced to explain 
individual predictions for any machine learning model based on Shapley values from 
game theory. For more detailed information, refer to the paper "A Unified Approach 
to Interpreting Model Predictions" (2017). [@lundberg2017unified]. 

The analysis relies on ROC-AUC and PR-AUC results. The feature number can be set 
using the `feature_num` parameter. Based on this specified feature count, the 
best-performing model across all CVs is selected to compute approximate Shapley 
values for each feature for all samples using the `fastshap` package in R.

```{r ML: SHAP analysis}
# conduct SHAP
shap_se <- ml_shap(ml_se, feature_num=10, nsim=5)
```

After running the above code, a SummarizedExperiment object `shap_se` will be
returned. It includes the input abundance data, lipid characteristic table, 
group information table, analysis results, and input parameter settings. 
You can view the data in `shap_se` by `LipidSigR::extract_summarized_experiment`.
Please read `vignette("1_tool_function")`.

```{r shap_analysis: results}
# view machine learning analysis
shap_result <- extract_summarized_experiment(shap_se)

# result summary
summary(shap_result)
```

`shap_se` can used to visualize several plots by further functions, such as 
`plot_ml_shap`, `plot_shap_sample`, `plot_shap_force`, and `plot_shap_dependence`. 
The instructions for these functions are provided in sequence below.

```{r ML: SHAP analysis plotting}
# plot SHAP results
shap_plots <- plot_ml_shap(shap_se)

# result summary
summary(shap_plots)

# view result: SHAP feature importance plot
shap_plots$static_feature_importance
```

**SHAP feature importance plot**
The top 10 features are ranked and demonstrated according to the average absolute 
value of shapely values from all samples.


```{r}
# view result: SHAP summary plot
shap_plots$static_summary_plot
```

**SHAP summary plot**
The SHAP summary plot illustrates the distribution of all shapely values for each 
feature. It uses sina plot to present important features by binary patterns. The 
color exemplifying the value of the feature from low (yellow) to high (purple) 
indicates the variable is high/low for that observation. The x-axis presents whether 
the impact is positive or negative on quality rating (target variable). In the 
summary plot, the relationship between the value of a feature and the influence on 
the prediction is shown.

Next, we are going to visualize the SHAP feature importance of N samples.
```{r ML: SHAP analysis_sample}
# sample list
sample_id_list <- unique(S4Vectors::metadata(shap_se)$shap_result$ID)

# visualize SHAP feature importance of 10 samples
sample_plots <- plot_shap_sample(shap_se, sample_id=sample_id_list[10])

# result summary
summary(sample_plots)

# view result: SHAP feature importance plot of 10 samples
sample_plots$static_sample_feature_importance  
```

**SHAP feature importance of 10 samples**


Lastly, we build the SHAP force plot and dependence plot with different parameter sets.

The SHAP force plot visualizes stacked Shapley values, illustrating how selected 
features impact the final output for each sample. The `top_feature` parameter allows 
users to set the number of top features to display, while the `group_num` parameter 
defines the number of clusters for grouping the samples.

```{r ML: SHAP analysis_forceplot}
# visualize each predictorâ€™s attributions
force_plots <- plot_shap_force(
    shap_se, top_feature=10, cluster_method="ward.D", group_num=10)

# result summary
summary(force_plots)

# view result: SHAP force plot
force_plots$static_forcePlot
```

**SHAP force plot**
The colors of the bars are filled according to the features.

The SHAP dependence plot enables exploration of how the model output varies with 
different feature values, revealing whether the relationship between the target 
variable and the feature is linear, monotonic, or more complex.

The x-axis, y-axis, and color of the plot can be customized. Typically, the x-axis 
represents the value of a specific feature, while the y-axis shows the corresponding
Shapley value. The color parameter can be set to examine potential interaction effects 
between a second feature and the plotted feature.

```{r ML: SHAP analysis_dependence_plot}
# feature lists
selected_feature <- as.character(
    unique(S4Vectors::metadata(shap_se)$shap_result$variable))

# visualize SHAP values against feature values for each variable
depend_plots <- plot_shap_dependence(
    shap_se, feature=selected_feature[1], shap_feature=selected_feature[2],
    interaction_index=selected_feature[2])

# result summary
summary(depend_plots)

# view result: SHAP dependence plot
depend_plots$static_dependence_plot
```

**SHAP dependence plot**


# Network {#network}
A correlation network enables us to examine interactions between features in a 
machine-learning model. Based on prior cross-validation results, an optimal feature 
count can be selected. The features from the best-performing model (based on 
ROC-AUC and PR-AUC) are then used to calculate correlation coefficients between 
each pair of features.

Nodes (features) are shaded based on their importance in constructing the network, 
while line width represents the correlation coefficient value between features. 
Two methods, 'Algorithm-based' and 'SHAP analysis,' are available for evaluating 
the importance of features. Detailed information on these methods can be found in 
the [Feature Importance section](#feaimp). In SHAP analysis, a positive or negative 
sign is assigned to feature importance based on the direction of feature values 
relative to the Shapley values of samples.

```{r ML: network}
# compute correlation coefficients and visualize correlation network
ml_network <- ml_corr_network(
    ml_se, feature_importance='Algorithm-based', correlation='pearson', 
    edge_cutoff=0, feature_num=10, nsim=5)

# result summary
summary(ml_network)

# view result: the network of feature importance
ml_network$static_correlation_network 
```
