\arguments{
\item{processed_se}{A SummarizedExperiment object constructed by
\code{\link{as_summarized_experiment}} and processed by \code{\link{data_process}}.}

\item{ncomp}{Numeric. The number of components to include in
the model. Default is \code{2}.}

\item{scaling}{Logical. If scaling = TRUE, each block is
standardized to zero means and unit variances. Default is \code{TRUE}.}

\item{clustering}{Character. The method to be used for clustering. Allowed method
include "kmeans", "kmedoids", "hclustering", "dbscan", "group_info". Default is \code{"kmeans"}.}

\item{cluster_num}{Numeric. A positive integer specifying the number of clusters.
The number must be between 1 and 10. Default is \code{2}.}

\item{kmedoids_metric}{Character. The metric to be used for calculating
dissimilarities between observations when choosing \code{"kmedoids"} as clustering method.
Must be one of "euclidean" and "manhattan". If "kmedoids" is not selected as
the clustering method, set the value to NULL.}

\item{distfun}{Character. The distance measure to be used when choosing \code{"hclustering"}
as clustering method. Allow method include "pearson", "kendall", "spearman",
"euclidean", "manhattan", "maximum", "canberra", "binary", and "minkowski".
If "hclustering" is not selected as the clustering method, set the value to NULL.}

\item{hclustfun}{Character. The agglomeration method to be used when choosing
\code{"hclustering"} as clustering method. This should be (an unambiguous abbreviation of)
one of "ward.D", "ward.D2", "single", "complete", "average" (=UPGMA),
"mcquitty" (= WPGMA), "median" (= WPGMC), or "centroid" (= UPGMC).
If "hclustering" is not selected as the clustering method, set the value to NULL.}

\item{eps}{Numeric. The size of the epsilon neighborhood when choosing \code{"dbscan"} as clustering method.
If "dbscan" is not selected as the clustering method, set the value to NULL.}

\item{minPts}{number of minimum points in the eps region (for core points) when choosing dbscan as clustering method.}
}
\value{
Return a list with 1 data frame, 1 interactive plot, and 1 static plot.
\enumerate{
\item plsda_result: A data frame of PLS-DA data.
\item table_plsda_loading: table for plotting PLS-DA loading plot.
\item interacitve_plsda & static_plsda: PLS-DA plot.
\item interactive_loadingPlot & static_loadingPlot: PLS-DA loading plot, display the variables that contribute to the definition of each component.

\description{
Partial least squares Discriminant Analysis (PLS-DA) is a dimensionality reduction
method that transforms data from a high-dimensional space into a low-dimensional
space while retaining the original data's essential properties.
