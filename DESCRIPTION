Description: 
    "LipidSigR" is an R package developed based on LipidSig web-based tool 
    (http://www.chenglab.cmu.edu.tw/lipidsig/). This package integrates a 
    comprehensive analysis for streamlined data mining of lipidomic datasets. 
    We provide 2 main analysis workflows, which is "Profiling" and "Differential 
    expression". Each section provides unique aspects to analyze the lipidome 
    profiling data based on different characteristics including lipid class, 
    chain length, unsaturation, hydroxyl group, and fatty acid composition.
    "Profiling" provides an overview of comprehensive analyses to efficiently 
    examine data quality, the clustering of samples, the correlation between 
    lipid species, and the composition of lipid characteristics. "Differential 
    expression" integrates many useful lipid-focused analyses for identifying 
    significant lipid species or lipid characteristics.
