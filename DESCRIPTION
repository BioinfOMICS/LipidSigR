Description:
    "LipidSigR" is an R package developed based on LipidSig web-based tool 
    (https://lipidsig.bioinfomics.org/). This package integrates a 
    comprehensive analysis for streamlined data mining of lipidomic datasets. 
    We provide 6 main analysis workflows, which is "Profiling", "Differential 
    expression", "Enrichment", "Network", "Machine learning", and "Correlation". 
    Each section provides unique aspects to analyze the lipidome profiling data 
    based on different characteristics including lipid class, chain length, 
    unsaturation, hydroxyl group, and fatty acid composition.
    "Profiling" provides an overview of comprehensive analyses to efficiently 
    examine data quality, the clustering of samples, the correlation between 
    lipid species, and the composition of lipid characteristics. "Differential 
    expression" integrates many useful lipid-focused analyses for identifying 
    significant lipid species or lipid characteristics. "Enrichment" 
    provides two main approaches: 'Over Representation Analysis (ORA)' and 'Lipid Set 
    Enrichment Analysis (LSEA)' to illustrates significant lipid species enriched in 
    the categories of lipid class and determine whether an a priori-defined set of 
    lipids shows statistically significant, concordant differences between two 
    biological states (e.g., phenotypes). "Network" provides functions for generates 
    input table for constructing pathway activity network, lipid reaction network 
    and GATOM network. "Machine learning" provides functions for building binary 
    classification models and several following analyses to evaluate algorithm 
    performance and identify critical lipid-related variables. 
    "Correlation" provides functions such as correlation coefficients and linear 
    regression to analyze continuous clinical features correlating with lipid 
    species or characteristics.
